# KeymapCEditor

WIP

Built version at the http://ciantic.github.io/keymapceditor/

## Development notes

Build a static version to `build/` using:
```
npm run build
```
It should work from local file by opening a `build/index.html` in browser, no need for a web server.

To start a hot reloading development server for convenience use:
```
npm run start
```

To run all tests in a watchmode:
```
npm run testwatch
```
